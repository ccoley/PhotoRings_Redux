================================================================================
External Dependencies:
 * Bootstrap CSS
 * Bootstrap JS

To use navbar:
 * Make sure you have included the external dependencies in your page.
 * Make sure your page is a .php file. (e.x. index.php vs index.html)
 * Make sure navbar.html and navbar.css are in the same directory.
 * Include the navbar.html file in your main .php file, above the main content.

Look at home.php for an example of how to use the NAVBAR.
