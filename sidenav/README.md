HOW TO USE SIDENAV ON YOUR PAGE
===============================
External Dependencies:
- Bootstrap CSS
- Bootstrap JS

To use sidenav:
- Make sure your page is a .php file. (e.x. index.php vs index.html)
- Make sure you have included the external dependencies in your page.
- Make sure sidenav.css has been included in your page.
- Include the sidenav.html file in your main .php file, above the main content.
- Your page must have a div for the sidenav and a div for the main page content.
- Give the sidenav div the classes "sidebar" and "pull-left", and include the sidenav.html file inside this div.
- Give the main content div the class "main" and put the rest of your page content inside this div.

Look at example.php for an example of how to use the SIDENAV.
